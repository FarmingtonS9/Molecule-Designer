Chemical bonds
The connection of electrons between atoms is called a chemical bond.
The bonding is an attractive force, and there are several types.
Typically, bonding follows the octet rule, where elements prefer a full outer shell of eight electrons. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule and does not hold up for most elements.

Types of bonds
Primary bonds
Covalent bonds
Typically formed by non-metallic elements, electrons are shared between each atom. These bonds are normally described and modelled by molecular orbital theory.

Ionic bonds

Metallic bonds
