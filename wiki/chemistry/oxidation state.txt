Oxidation State
Oxidation state of an atom is the total number of electrons removed or added to an element in its present state.

Rules 
1. Oxidation state of an uncombined element is always zero. This applied regardless of the structure of the element: Xe, Cl2, S8 and large structures of carbon and silicon each have an oxidation state of zero.
2. The sum of the oxidation state of all atoms or ions in a neutral compound is zero.
3. The sum of the oxidation state of all atoms in an ion is equal to the charge on the ion.
4. The more electronegative element in a substance is assigned a negative oxidation state, the less electronegative element is assigned a positive oxidation state.
5. Some elements almost always have the same oxidation states in their compounds:
- Group 1 metals -> +1
- Group 2 metals -> +2
- Oxygen -> -2, except peroxides and F20
- Hydrogen -> +1, except metal hydrides
- Fluorine -> -1
- Chlorine -> -1, except compounds with F or O
Exceptions
- Metal hydride
- Oxygen in Peroxide
- Oxygen in F2O
- Chlorine in compounds with fluorine or oxygen
