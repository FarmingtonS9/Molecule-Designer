# Molecule-Designer
Personal project to learn chemistry and physics. Molecule Designer is a tool to build molecules and compounds using the least amount of elemental data.

# Purpose
Purpose is 2-fold:
1. To build understanding of chemistry and physics using readily available information (i.e from the internet). A personal purpose.
2. To build molecules and compounds using the elements with derived properties and behaviours. The idea is to figure out what the least amount of information  is needed for an element to build molecules
 - An example: You can derive the Atomic Number (Z) from the number of protons of an element (# of protons = Atomic Number). The Atomic Number then can combined to with the number of neutrons, called the nucleon.
